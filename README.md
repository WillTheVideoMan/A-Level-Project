# A-Level Project
My A-Level Computer science project is one which took too long and only just about works. Over the span of about 4000 lines I have made a tracking system for a school sponsored walk, using QR codes as the tracking medium, and an Android app as the scanner (Built with MIT App Inventor).

### Some key and interesting facts: 
 - Full User Account Control;
 - A Visual Overview
 - A Sorted Table
 - Google OAuth 2 Included
 - Lot's of PHP
 - Many Tears
 
 ### Hope you enjoy reading about it as much as I enjoyed making it...
